GREETR (mini) framework built as part of an advanced Javascript course

When given a first name, last name, and optional language, it generates formal and informal greetings.

Supports Engligh and Spanish.

Reusable library/framework.

Easy to type structure.

Supports jQuery. Project includes compressed jQuery. I did not write this.

Ready to run out of box with live example. Just clone the repository and run index.html
